# Green-Sense---CV-Project
Green Sense is a computer vision pipeline for automated urban vegetation quality monitoring from street-level municipal camera imagery. The project classifies green spaces into Healthy, Dried, and Contaminated conditions using synthetic data generation (FIBO), Vision Transformers (ViT-B16) and a hybrid CLIP–DINOv2 architecture.
